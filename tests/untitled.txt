Support: this is the Resource Prominence parameter, it helps you to ignore unimportant or uninformative resources. When you set a value X to it, this means resources that have a number of Wikipedia in-links smaller than X will be ignored and not returned to you.

Confidence: this is the Disambiguation Confidence parameter, it is a threshold which takes a value between 0 and 1. When you set a high value to it, you get better and more trustworthy annotations but you risk losing some correct ones.
