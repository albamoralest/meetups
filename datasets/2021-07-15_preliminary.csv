0,[],0,[],9039,I believe he should be rated much more highly as a be-bop guitarist.
0,[],0,[],9039,"For chords he developed a novel system based largely around 3-note chords, each of which could serve as the equivalent of several conventional chords in different inversions; for the treble notes he could employ his ring and little fingers to fret the relevant high strings even though he could not articulate these fingers independently, while in some chords he also employed his left hand thumb on the lowest string."
0,[],0,[],9039,"Within his rapid melodic runs he frequently incorporated arpeggios, which could be played using 2 notes per string (played with his 2 ""good"" fingers, being his index and middle fingers) while shifting up or down the fingerboard, as opposed to the more conventional ""box"" approach of moving across strings within a single fretboard position (location)."
0,[],0,[],9039,"He also produced some of his characteristic ""effects"" by moving a fixed shape (such as a diminished chord) rapidly up and down the fretboard, resulting in what one writer has called ""intervallic cycling of melodic motifs and chords""."
0,[],0,[],9039,"First of all, his instrumental technique is vastly superior to that of all other jazz guitarists."
